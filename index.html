          <p>helloo, i'm keaton (they/them)! but you may know me as stickertime :) i'm currently a student in singapore and a self-taught writer, artist and coder. i'm only somewhat proficient in html/css, though i'm planning to learn javascript in the near future!</p>
          <p>i think i spend waaay too much time online but i'm really interested in web culture. i cycle through many, many hyperfixations, but my other main interests include: psychology, sociology, literature, art, programming and music etc. i just think about the human condition a lot, it's pretty neat!</p>
          <p>in my free time, i like playing minecraft, listening to music and reading/writing poetry. if you'd like to hear me ramble about stuff i like, hit me up at my discord <u>@stickertime</u> or check out any of the public social media i have below!</p>

          <h3>about the site</h3>
          <p>this website was built entirely from scratch in 2023 on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">vscode</a> and is best viewed on desktop at 100%! it will serve as a central hub/portfolio for all my projects, as well as a place for me to share things i find interesting.</p>
          <p>currently, it's still a huge work-in-progress and updates might be few and far between as i'm still a full-time student. i'm planning to migrate to my own domain soon, so make sure to check in every once in a while :3!</p>
