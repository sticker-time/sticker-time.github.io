      <p>hi! removed commonplace because my twitter quote bot is alive again. added projects + links page for things i make and things i like :3 changed website colour so its easier on the eyes (imo) aaaand updated homepage (yes the ghost is me! photo was taken by my good friend dorian)</p>
      <p>i'm gonna add other social media sites you can find me on soon. and also update the blog/projects/links page. i'm also planning to migrate my site to a different url!! yayyyy. look out for more updates!</p>

      <p>hoo boy it's been a while, huh? my exams are finally over and i have the sudden motivation to work on this site again :DD replaced "faves" section with "blog" so i can ramble, which is a wip until i can figure out how to actually make a blog. i also finally added something to the collection section, which will serve as a commonplace alongside my tumblr and twitter. i also added some goofy ahh <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/snailspng/727675505887838208" target="_blank">images</a> to spice up the place a little! yayy. ok. see u again in an indeterminate amount of time!</p>
